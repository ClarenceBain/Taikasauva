## Taikasauva

Taikasauva is a simple wand creator for the game Noita, and was made for the purpose of
spawning wands without enabling mods in the games settings.

Taikasauva was built around loading the script from .tai files, but also includes a wand
creator without the use of .tai files (albeit barebones and not flashy).

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* Noita which can be purchased [here.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/)
* Some sort of .DLL injector, I personally just use [Cheat Engine.](https://www.cheatengine.org/)

### Installation & Usage

1. Download the files [here.](https://github.com/ClarenceBain/Taikasauva/Latest)
2. Move the "taikasauva" folder to Noita's directory
  * Should be somewhere along the lines of C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\
3. Move the taikasauva.dll to a location of your liking
4. Start Noita
5. Inject the .DLL into Noita
6. Have fun!
